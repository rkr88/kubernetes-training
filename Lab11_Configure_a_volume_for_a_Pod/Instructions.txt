Step1: Create the Pod

    kubectl apply -f redis.yaml

Step 2: Verify that the Podâ€™s Container is running, and then watch for changes to the Pod

    kubectl get pod redis --watch

Step 3: In another terminal, get a shell to the running Container

    kubectl exec -it redis -- /bin/bash

Step 4: In your shell, go to /data/redis, and then create a file

    cd /data/redis/

    echo Hello > test-file

Step 5: In your shell, list the running processes

    apt-get update

    apt-get install procps

    ps aux


Step 6: In your shell, kill the Redis process


    kill <pid>

In your original terminal, watch for changes to the Redis Pod.


At this point, the Container has terminated and restarted. This is because the Redis Pod has a restartPolicy of Always

Step 7: Get a shell into the restarted Container

    kubectl exec -it redis -- /bin/bash

Step 8: In your shell, goto /data/redis, and verify that test-file is still there

    cd /data/redis/

    ls

Step 9: Delete the Pod that you created for this exercise

    kubectl delete pod redis
