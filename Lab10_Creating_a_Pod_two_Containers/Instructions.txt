Step 1: Create the Pod and the two Containers

    kubectl apply -f two-container-pod.yaml

Step 2: View information about the Pod and the Containers

    kubectl get pod two-containers --output=yaml

Step 3: Get a shell to nginx Container

    kubectl exec -it two-containers -c nginx-container -- /bin/bash

Step 4: In your shell, verify that nginx is running

    apt-get update

    apt-get install curl procps

    ps aux

Recall that the debian Container created the index.html file in the nginx root directory.

Step 5: Use curl to send a GET request to the nginx server

    curl localhost
